  <h1>I Love Bacon</h1>
  <p>Ah, bacon. Besides being delectable and one of humankindâ€™s most fabulous creations, there are numerous other reasons why you can allow yourself to revel in the tasty cured meat more often. For one, bacon has nutrients. A 3.5-ounce (100 grams) portion of bacon has around 37 grams of protein, a good amount of B vitamins, and 89% of the daily recommended amount of selenium. Also, if you plan to go on a keto diet, bacon will be your most trusted ally.</p>
